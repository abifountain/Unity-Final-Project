  dialogueLines:
  - Sorry, I've not had the best morning and may be a little irritable. How are you?
  - Yes, there was a rabbit causing a real ruckus this morning.
  - ...
  - Yes, I saw that FOOL. He passed by here a while ago.
  - 'He stomped on by, waking up the entire forest and bragging about how he''s going
    to win a race. '
  - Wait, are you his opponent??
  - 'Tsk tsk I don''t know if you have a chance to be honest '
  - BUT I detest that rabbit and want to help you win.
  - If you jump on my head (It's not as bad as it seems) you'll get an extra bounce.
  - 'Yeah, anything I can do to stop that doofus from winning.  '
  - I'll alert all of the other mushrooms in the forest so they can help too.
  - Now go and pass that finish line first!
