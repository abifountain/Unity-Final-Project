  dialogueLines:
  - Well well well, I've been waiting for you!
  - I heard that there's a great race underway and just had to see!
  - No no, a winner has not been declared yet!
  - 'You still have a chance. '
  - Yes, and you're probably a great swimmer so you're essentially guaranteed a win!
  - You can't swim?! What was your plan?
  - I guess you could try jumping across the lily pads.
  - 'But you''ll probably need a double jump for that. '
  - 'Which I can help you with! '
  - Something like that...
  - " \u2666 \u263C \u2665 \u266A  \u2663 \u266B \u2660 \u2248"
  - What's that look for? You should be light as a feather and able to double jump
    now!
  - Oh you didn't know? That'll be $1,000,000.
  - I'm just kidding.
  - 'Just let me know if you have any strange side effects. '
  - ... I meant like a headache or nausea.
  - 'I''m going to try and escape this painfully awkward conversation, good luck! '
  - 'I''m rooting for you, good luck! '
